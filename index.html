Here’s a refined, professional, and assertive version of your draft, keeping the strong pushback intact while making it flow more clearly and impactfully:

**Subject:** NRC Reporting Issue – ICT Revenue Recognition

**Dear Kaka Ziad and Kaka Kardoo,**

Given the above, it is clear that the system still has unresolved glitches. The question is: why is B2B ICT being penalized by not having its revenue booked under the correct head, especially when relevant reports are already being generated by the concerned teams?

We request urgent support from the booking team to consider manual recognition until this issue is permanently fixed. The attached emails clearly show that the matter remains open with PD. It is simply **unfair that ICT is being deprived of 7 million IQD of earned revenue due to system errors.**

B2B is not responsible for this reporting issue, and our booked revenue should not be excluded from ICT’s accounts because of a system swap.

Best regards,
\[Your Name]

Mujtaba, do you want me to make this **escalation-ready** (sharper, with a line implying senior management will need to be looped in if not fixed immediately) or keep it **collaborative but firm** as it is now?
